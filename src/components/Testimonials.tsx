      testimonial: "Alan is one of the greatest people I had the honour to work with. He is always organized, with great leading skills, searching for better solutions. He doesn't keep aside from the problem but always tries to solve it. Amazing team player: he helps, advises, if required, discusses in meeting with managers about issues you happen to have. He is a person who will always ask about your personal life, somebody who very soon becomes a friend not only a college, even if you are physically located on different continents. I would like to recommend Alan because I think he is the best candidate for a leading position in any company.",

      testimonial: "Alan is wonderful to work with. He is forward looking, continually thinking of ideas to solve problems. I had the privilege of being Alanâ€™s manager and working with Alan for 4 years. Alan is the type of team member everyone wants on their team - talented, friendly, always eager to learn new skills and help the rest of the team. When discussing challenges, opportunities, and new ideas, Alan would explore the best solutions and lead our team of developers to implement the most effective and efficient javascript applications, mobile applications, or alternate solutions. I would highly recommend Alan.",
